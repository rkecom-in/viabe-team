"""Owner-input extraction writer (VT-146).

Reads an inbound WhatsApp owner message body from the request-scoped
``WebhookEvent`` and classifies it into structured
``intent / segment / occasion`` via an Anthropic Haiku call. The
derived row is written to ``owner_inputs`` via the tenant-scoped
connection helper. Raw body is NEVER persisted by this writer — the
table has no body column (migration ``020_owner_inputs.sql``) and the
classifier's input is dropped after the Messages-API round-trip
returns.

Privacy posture (Fazal brief, VT-146):

- **RETAINED**: the table holds derived ``intent / segment / occasion``
  only.
- **TRANSMITTED**: the body text is sent to Anthropic for classification
  on each inbound message. WhatsApp BSP + Anthropic Commercial Terms
  permit this; the executed DPA + Zero Data Retention request gate
  MERGE (Ship Gate).
- **DERIVED**: the classification fields are what downstream code reads
  (Composer -> agent).

Failure mode: classification errors must NOT break the inbound webhook
pipeline. Callers wrap the writer in best-effort try/except — a
classification miss leaves the pipeline running and is observable via
the routed ``FailureRecord`` path. See ``run_extraction_for_event`` for
the recommended call site.

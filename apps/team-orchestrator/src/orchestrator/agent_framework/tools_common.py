"""The COMMON READ tools — the Manager-scoped operational-data reads a specialist pulls itself.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
ARCHITECTURE.md §1.3 ("READ tools — DB/context reads … always scoped to the Manager's resolved
tenant") + §1.1 ("the specialist pulls operational data itself via Manager-scoped READ tools").
The Manager gathers only the FRAMING data (situation / desired_outcome / context_slice); the
operational datum a specialist needs — the ledger shape, the business profile, the integration
phase — it pulls through these three registered READ tools rather than the Manager pre-fetching
everything (which forces over- or under-fetch, §1.1).

Each is a langchain ``@tool`` wrapping an EXISTING read implementation — it re-expresses a real
reader on the tool contract, it does NOT re-author the business logic:

  - ``read_customer_ledger_summary`` → ``db.wrappers.CustomersWrapper`` counts
    (``count_all`` / ``count_with_sales`` / ``count_lapsed`` at the CL-2026-07-10 45-day
    ``LAPSED_WINDOW_DAYS`` definition — the SAME function the owner-facing status count uses).
  - ``read_business_context``        → ``knowledge.business_context.read_business_context`` (the
    manager's own §7 business-context READ seam, the one ``dispatch.py`` composes over).
  - ``read_integration_state``       → ``onboarding.shopify_onboarding.read_integration_state``
    (the SAME seam the integration agent's own ``read_integration_state`` tool delegates to —
    imported, never duplicated).

THE THREE INVARIANTS every tool here holds
------------------------------------------
1. RESOLVE-FIRST, MODEL-UNTRUSTED (§1.1 / §3 / the VT-293/294/599 IDOR guard): the first line is
   ``resolve_lane_tenant(tenant_id, tool_name=…)`` — the ambient dispatch ``ObservabilityContext``
   WINS; a model-supplied ``tenant_id`` that disagrees is logged + ignored. An unresolvable tenant
   returns the structured ``lane_tenant_error`` dict — NEVER a raise (a raise inside a lane-driven
   tool orphans the tool_use / hangs the run, the VT-599 defect).
2. OWN RLS SCOPE, NEVER A PASSED CONNECTION (§3): a DB tool takes the RESOLVED tenant and opens its
   OWN ``tenant_connection`` (or delegates to a reader that does). It never accepts a ``conn``
   argument and never touches a raw/BYPASSRLS pool — the §3 DB-access rule. ``read_customer_ledger_
   summary`` opens ONE ``tenant_connection(resolved)`` and threads it through the wrapper counts so
   the whole summary is one RLS-scoped, single-checkout read; the other two delegate to readers
   that each open their own ``tenant_connection``. (The §3 DB-access INVERSION — the tool taking a
   Manager-owned session — is explicitly DEFERRED; this is today's sanctioned pattern.)
3. CL-390 PII-SAFE: a READ tool return carries COUNTS / IDS / STATUSES / the owner's own business
   fields ONLY — never a customer name/phone/email. ``read_customer_ledger_summary`` returns pure
   integers; ``read_business_context`` returns the owner's own business data (identity/profile/
   objective — not customer PII) + a boolean for L1 presence (the rendered block is not dumped);
   ``read_integration_state`` returns the phase + connector id + a pending-waypoint envelope that
   by construction carries only connector/field-mapping identifiers, never raw customer PII.

IMPORT SURFACE (deliberate — this is a langchain-carrying module, like ``agent/integration_agent``)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defining ``@tool`` objects at module load pulls ``langchain_core`` (exactly as the integration
agent's own tool module does), so THIS file is NOT dep-less-smoke safe and is imported LAZILY by
``CommonToolsModule`` (at instance construction) and by any wiring seam — never by
``agent_framework/__init__`` (whose import surface stays inert + dep-less). The ``orchestrator.agent``
re-exports it leans on (``lane_tenant`` / ``tool_guardrail``) are light: ``agent/__init__`` is a PEP
562 lazy shim, so those imports pull no model build. The DB/knowledge/onboarding readers are
LAZY-imported INSIDE each tool (psycopg / KG chains kept off even this module's import surface),
mirroring the lane-tool discipline.

INERT: nothing live reads through these yet. Wiring the Manager / specialist live paths to
``COMMON_READ_TOOLS`` is a deliberate follow-on, not done here.
